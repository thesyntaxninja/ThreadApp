The purpose of this problem sets is to give you practical experience with the creating a GUI application in a form, and using the C# threading model.
 
After you have completed these problem, you will have built a program that is a C# Windows application 
The application will be forms based and will use a panel, buttons, color chooser dialog, graphics objects, and threads
The user will be able to select a shape and color, and thread speed.  Then the selected shape will bounce inside the panel.  The program will use separate thread to manage and draw each shape.
You also need to include a pause/restart button.  When a user strikes pause, all shapes need to freeze on the screen.  When the user hits pause/resume again all shapes need to resume moving.
